1) Browsers work by finding, retrieving and displaying content such as images, videos and web pages on the World Wide Web. I use Chrome the most because I have a HP computer and it seems to run the quickest for me, however I use the Safari browser on my phone because I have an iPhone and haven't took the time to download Chrome.

2) Markup language is basically the handwritten (well I guess they would be typed) manuscripts that tell someone how a particular page should be laid out. They work in a way to govern the display, formatting and organization of text elements. I think the most commonly known markup language used in development is HTML and is the only one that I have vaguely heard of before this course.
