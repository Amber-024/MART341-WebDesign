<h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <div id="lyrics" class="container" class="lyrics" > </div>
  <p>You said that I drank too much
  The tattoos in my skin are not your style
  You didn't like cigarette on my kiss
  Well I hope thats something you miss
  'Cause I'm not slowin' down for a while
  </br>
  I'd been desperate to fix what we've been
  But some things need to stay broken
  I realized you're not worth me tryin to hide
  </br>
  'Cause baby you don't own me
  You never could control me
  The road you're on looks lonely
  And I hope like hell it is
  </br>
  I'm never gonna be your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen
  I'm never gonna be your red dress, long leg, blonde haired southern dream
  I know I'm worth more than just the pretty things
  And that's alright by me
  </br>
  I wanted you so bad that I couldn't see
  The truth was sittin' there in front of me
  It was never love, it was never real
  You wanted something to fix, not something to feel
  But I am not your accessory
  I'm not a marionette for your passenger seat
  A lesson learned and now I'm free
  Your green eyes look like shit to me
  </br>
  'Cause baby you don't own me
  You never could control me
  The road you're on looks lonely
  And I hope like hell it is
  </br>
  I'm never gonna be your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen
  I'm never gonna be your red dress, long leg, blonde haired southern dream
  I know I'm worth more than just the pretty things
  And that's alright by me
  </br>
  So won't you go on and marry that lady
  Wears Louis Vuitton
  Drives around in her Mercedes
  Says downtown Dallas is the place to be
  Daddy gave her everything she's got for free
  She looks real good with her head down low
  Always minds her business in your shadow
  Kisses your ass like you wanted me to
  Well good luck honey, he's all for you
  </br>
  'Cause baby you don't own me
  You never could control me
  The road you're on looks lonely
  And I hope like hell it is
  </br>
  I'm never gonna be your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen
  I'm never gonna be your red dress, long leg, blonde haired southern dream
  I know I'm worth more than just the pretty things
  And that's alright by me
  </p>
