1) I believe that you can have as many or as few headings as you possibly want but each page really has one body. Headings direct the readers attention to what that section of the body entails and the body is the information as a whole.
2) Structural markup is responsible for the layout of the page while Sematic markup is used to create bolded sections or italic sections along with many others.
3)For this assignment I opened atom and then opened the assignment. I started off with the things that I already knew how to do, like the four basic elements of a HTML. Then I opened the course website and followed along. When I noticed that a topic was on my to do list for the assignment, I stopped and began that part of the assignment and continued this way until the assignment was done.
