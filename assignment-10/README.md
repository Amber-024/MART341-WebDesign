1) Universal makes all the style changes happen to every element on the HTML. This would be used when you want the entire page to be uniform and all the same. An element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type, using an element name. This is used when you want the heading and the paragraphs and other elements to all have different looks. Class selectors is a way that styles elements in the same div that are prepended with a single dot. Lastly, ID selectors allow developers to define style rules for specific elements by calling its unique ID.
2) I chose green (RGB: rgb(0,255,0) Hex: ##00ff00 ), pink ( RGB: rgb(255,105,180) Hex: ##ffc0cb), and orange(RGB: rgb(243,156,18) HEX: ##f39c12). I chose these colors because in the 80's these were very popular colors.
3) Honestly my biggest struggle this week was finding the motivation to complete the assignment! We are nearing the end of the semester and I really need to just keep going!
