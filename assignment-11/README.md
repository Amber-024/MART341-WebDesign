1) System fonts are the fonts that are typically universal on your local drive and system but are not usually on the web. Web fonts are fonts that are hosted on a server and do not have to be available on the user's device to appear. Web-safe fonts are fonts that developers can count on being available.
2) The importance of a fallback font is that you have a back up font when the font is taking to long to load on a new server.
3) There was a lot of information but instead of working on the assignment all at once like I normally do, I took it day by day so I didn't get overwhelmed.
