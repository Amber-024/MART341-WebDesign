<<p>The book begins with a pig named Wilbur is born the runt of the liter. The father wants to kill the piggy but the eight year old little girl Fern wouldn't let that happen. She convinces her dad to let her keep the piglet. After Wilbur becomes too big for the house, and has to move to Uncle Homer Zuckerman. At the uncles house Wilbur makes friends with the other farm animals and most importantly Charlotte, the tiny grey spider. Once Wilbur and his friends realize that Wilbur will eventually end up on the butcher block, Charlotte comes up with a plan to save his life. She writes three messages in her web above Wilbur to save his life. The first message says "some pig", then "terrific" and the last one before the fair reads "Radiant." After all of the messages left in the web, the uncle decides to take Wilbur to the fair and show him off. As Charlotte sees all of her work pay off, she writes one more word at the fair that reads "Humble." Wilbur wins a special prize at the fair and now we know that the uncle would never kill such a special pig. Sadly, Charlotte begins to die after saving Wilburs life. However, Wilbur knew that she saved his life and now was his turn to do something good. Wilbur takes Charlotte's egg sac back to the farm so that her 514 eggs could hatch at the farm. Tragically, Charlotte dies alone at the fair but when spring comes around Wilbur has all of Charlotte's babies to make friends with.</p>
