1) On the Wayback Machine I looked at Amazon because I tend to shop on Amazon more than anywhere else. The website has changed drastically, and is much more visually appealing to the eye. Everything is very plain and mainly consists of lines, text and images. There isn't a visual appeal that we would see on Websites today.

2)I learned a lot because I have never used any of these programs before. I find it pretty difficult but I enjoy the challenge. I had a hard time getting things to load quickly so I have to space out the assignments but I think that it is just slow internet causing that. I certainly find myself having to review that last assignments to make sure that I am doing things correctly.
