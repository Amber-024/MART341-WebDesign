    <P> I have choose a recipe for Pumpkin bars because my favorite thing about the fall season. Of all the seasons fall is already my favorite season. On top of all of the pretty fall color, it is a family tradition to begin making baked good and candies. Of all of the recipes we make during the fall, Pumpkin bars are by far the best. You can find the full recipe at <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/pumpkin-bars/" target="blank">Pumpkin Bars</a> </P>
