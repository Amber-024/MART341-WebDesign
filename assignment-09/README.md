1) Everything seemed pretty easy but it's just time consuming to try and find everything that we have learned but forgot little pieces of info from. I think it is a lot of information all in a short time frame so it is hard to retain all of the information.
2) I think that it is all pretty interesting, I'm excited to see how much more appealing the website can be.
3) My biggest challenge is remembering everything, but I just put in more time reviewing the concepts that we have learned to make sure that everything is being incorporated.
