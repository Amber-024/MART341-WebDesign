1)Google's webpage has many types of forms. On the main page is a text box and a submit form that allows you to access information that you desire. They serve the purpose of making the website appealing but also to make external links and information easily accessible.
2)An example of a text is a discussion forum on Moodle. You are able to have someone on another device access the website and type in whatever is needed into that text box. Selection is used to restrict the users answer choice to a multiple choice option. Buttons are used to direct you to other links or in the case of a submit button, it is used to submit some sort of information to a database such as a subscription to a newsletter.
3) For this assignment I started by going opening Atom and doing all of the assignment that I knew that I could do. When I came to a spot that I no longer knew what to do, I opened the course website and started to go through the lessons until I knew how to do another part of the assignment. Then while that information was fresh in my head, I completed that part of the assignment and continued this until the assignment was complete.
