        My biggest passion at the moment is my puppy. He is a 7 months old and I got him during this last summer. We as a family have had a lot of loses this summer and now my dog has became my whole world. Below is a picture of my dog the first day that I got him!

        This summer, my dog did everything with me. We went paddleboarding, hiking, camping, and in general just explored everything that we could. My favorite memory is when I took him paddle boarding and he did really good when the water was clear and deep but we found a patch that was covered in lily pads and it was very decieving. He took a deep plunge that scared him, but he learned to stay on the paddleboard until he was told to get off!

        Kaiser loves to be seen down by the river and to just explore whatever we can.
