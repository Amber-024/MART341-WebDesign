1)I've learned a lot but I am sad that I wont be doing anything with it once this course is finished. I took the class as a filler course but I genuinely enjoyed it.
I had no knowledge about anything web page related before this and so that means that I really learned a lot.
I really didn't have a lot of challenges because I just reviewed all of the assignments that we had over the semester and gradually built my final project.
